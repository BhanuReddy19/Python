Flow of Execution – if-elif-else Statement

Check the if condition first
If the condition is True, execute the if block

Skip all other elif and else parts

If the if condition is False, then Python checks the first elif condition

If True, execute that block
Skip remaining elif and else

If all if and elif conditions are False, then the else block will execute
else has no condition

It is the “default” block
