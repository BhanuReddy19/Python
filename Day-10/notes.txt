Conditional statements
 Conditional statements are used to make decisions in a program.It helps the program choose which block of code to execute based on some condition (True or False).

 if
if-else
if-elif-else
Nested if (if inside another if)

Syntax of if Statement 
if condition:
# block of code

Flow of Execution :
Python checks the condition.
If condition is True, the code inside if block runs.
If condition is False, nothing inside the block runs.

Syntax of if-else Statement
if condition:
    # executes if condition is True
else:
    # executes if condition is False

 Flow of Execution :
Condition is evaluated.
If True → if block runs.
If False → else block runs.

##--- Relationaloperators

Relational operators are used to compare two values.They always return a Boolean value → True or False.

==	Equal to	          5 == 5	True
!=	Not equal to	      5 != 3	True
>	Greater than	      7 > 4	True
<	Less than	          3 < 8	True
>=	Greater than or equal to	5 >= 5	True
<=	Less than or equal to        4 <= 6 True

If the comparison is correct/valid → returns True, otherwise False

## --Assignment Operators

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables it can also perform an operation and then assign.


=	Assign value	
+=	Add and assign	
-=	Subtract and assign	
*=	Multiply and assign	
/=	Divide and assign 	
//=	Floor divide and assign	
%=	Modulus and assign	
**=	Power and assign
