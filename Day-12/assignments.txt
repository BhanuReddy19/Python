1. What is return statement in a function. 
2. What is return type in a function. 
2. Write different programs with return statements. At least 10 +.

Note: Try to re write all these programs with return statements.


    1. Write a program to add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers.

       Use arithmetic operators.
       Input: two numbers
       Output: results of all four operations

    2. Write a program to check whether a number is even or odd.

       Use modulus operator %
       Use an if–else statement.

    3. Write a program to find the largest of three numbers.

       Input: three numbers
       Use nested if or logical operators.

    4. Write a function to calculate the square of a number.

       print the result.

    5. Write a program to check whether a number is positive, negative, or zero.

       Use multiple conditional statements (if–elif–else).

    6. Write a program that takes a username and prints a greeting message using a function.

       Function should accept a name and print a welcome message.

    7. Write a program to calculate the simple interest.

       Use the formula:
       SI = (P × R × T) / 100

    8. Write a program to check if a given year is a leap year.

       Use conditions:
       Divisible by 4
       Not divisible by 100 unless divisible by 400

    9. Write a program to find the greatest of two numbers using a function.

       Function receives two numbers and print the larger one.

    10. Write a program that reads a number and print whether it is divisible by both 3 and 5.

       Use logical operator and.

       print the result.

    5. Write a program to check whether a number is positive, negative, or zero.

       Use multiple conditional statements (if–elif–else).

    6. Write a program that takes a username and prints a greeting message using a function.

       Function should accept a name and print a welcome message.

    8. Write a program to check if a given year is a leap year.

       Use conditions:
       Divisible by 4
       Not divisible by 100 unless divisible by 400

    9. Write a program to find the greatest of two numbers using a function.

       Function receives two numbers and print the larger one.

    10. Write a program that reads a number and print whether it is divisible by both 3 and 5.

       Use logical operator and.
